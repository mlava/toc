If you do a lot of long-form writing (or reading) in Roam Research, you've probably always wanted this extension: Table of Contents.

You can trigger this extension by opening the Command Palette and choosing 'Create a Table of Contents (toc)'. The extension will scan your page for all of your headings and create a floating, sticky Table of Contents to the right of your page.

![toc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6857790/204086802-28cd5b53-f64e-40b9-a3c0-17c8e93a4b44.gif)

As you can see in the gif, if you add or remove any headings, the TOC will be automatically updated. The same applies if you change from H1 to H2 and so on. If you navigate to a new page in your graph, the TOC will be removed. (You will need to re-create the TOC if you return to your page and still need it.)

If you open the right sidebar, the TOC will move left so that it doesn't obstruct the sidebar content.

TODO:
1. explore whether creating a TOC for a page can be persisted so that you don't need to re-create it if you go back to that page.
2. ~~configure TOC css to respect the css of any themes applied to your graph, including Roam Studio (just refresh the TOC by using the Command Palette)~~
